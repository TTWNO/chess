# chess
Chess engine in c++

Will turn into game eventually.

### Compiling

`cd src`

`make && ./chess.out`

#### Comiling Tests
`cd tests`

`make && ./tests.out -s`

The -s option prints the values of tests that pass, as well as tests that fail.
If you want to only print the values of tests that fail, remove the -s flag.
