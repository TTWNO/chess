// Get bits 13-16 of int
// Get bits 17-20 of int
// Get 21st bit of int
// Get 22nd bit of int
// Get 23rd bit of int

// Get last 3 bits of number (the rank).
// Techincally this gets all bits 4-32/64 but I'm just assuming it won't be larger than 63 before the shift.

// Get first 3 bits of number
// if the position has a 7th bit we know it's off the board.

// it indicates that is it off the board.
// ASSUMING position <= 128 but if it was that big that'd be weird.
